This project was created during a mandatory internship for my university coursework.

The main aim of the project was to implement cellulary automatons as well as Lindenmayer generators.

the project was divided roughly into three stages. First stage consisted of the creation of an abstract Generator class from which all the implemented cellular automatons
and the Lindenmayer generations inherit. In this stage I also implemented the classes of Simplegenerator which produces a simple blue circle and the ElementaryCellularAutomaton
which produces geometric shapes based on Wolfram's elementary rules. In the second stage I implemented the Conway's game of life automaton and the
forest fire automaton. The Game of Life Automaton produces short black and white animations which are basically rapidfire iterations through different images giving a slightly
cartoonish impression. In the forest fire automaton, an approach common for modeling actual forest fires was implemented and shows how red dots (fires) on a green canvas(forest)
spread during the iteration process.  In the third and final stage of this project I implemented two Lindenmayer generators which generate plant like shapes and figures that are 
highly complex in their patterns. The Lindenmayer approach is a legitimate approach used in plant taxonomy.
